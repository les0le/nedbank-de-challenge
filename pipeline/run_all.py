"""
Pipeline entry point.

Orchestrates the three medallion architecture stages in order:
  1. Ingest  — reads raw source files into Bronze layer Delta tables
  2. Transform — cleans and conforms Bronze into Silver layer Delta tables
  3. Provision — joins and aggregates Silver into Gold layer Delta tables

The scoring system invokes this file directly:
  docker run ... python pipeline/run_all.py

Do not add interactive prompts, argument parsing that blocks execution,
or any code that reads from stdin. The container has no TTY attached.
